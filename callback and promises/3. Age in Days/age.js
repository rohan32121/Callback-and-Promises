// 3. Age in Days.

// Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last
// name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string
// and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a
// variable called ageInDays.


// The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The
// message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full
// name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]."


// Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return
// a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time.

const person = {
    firstName: "Rohan",
    lastName: "Karki", 
    age: 23
};

function ageInDays(personObject, callback) {
    const fullName = `${personObject.firstName} ${personObject.lastName}`;
    const ageInDays = personObject.age * 365;
    callback(fullName, ageInDays)
}
function logresult(fullName, ageInDays) {
    console.log(`The Person's ${fullName} and their ages in days is ${ageInDays}`);
    
}
